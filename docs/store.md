# DM Screen

DM Screen is a lightweight DM panel for Owlbear Rodeo.  
Open **Notion pages**, **PDFs**, and **links** inside your room — keep notes **DM-only by default** and share selected content with players when the story needs it.

## Highlights

- **Organize your prep:** folders + subfolders (Acts, Encounters, NPCs, Handouts…)
- **Open fast during play:** click any item to view it in a modal
- **Share with players:** toggle visibility with the **👁️** icon (page or folder)
- **Handouts:** click images to view full screen and **Show to players**
- **Token links:** right-click a token to link a page and open it instantly later
- **Reload when needed:** use **🔄** to pull the latest changes

## Quick start

1) Add the extension in Owlbear using the manifest URL below  
2) Click **➕** to add folders or pages  
3) Add a Notion page / PDF / link  
4) Share anything with **👁️** when you’re ready
