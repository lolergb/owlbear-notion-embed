# GM Vault

GM Vault is a lightweight GM vault for Owlbear Rodeo.  
Open **Notion pages**, **PDFs**, and **links** inside your room — keep content **GM-only by default** and share selected notes and handouts with players when it matters.

> **Official builds:** Only manifests served from `owlbear-gm-vault.netlify.app` are official. See [TRADEMARK.md](https://github.com/lolergb/owlbear-gm-vault/blob/main/TRADEMARK.md) for branding policy.

## Highlights

- **Organize your prep:** folders + subfolders (Acts, Encounters, NPCs, Handouts…)
- **Open fast during play:** click any item to view it in a modal
- **Share with players:** toggle visibility with the **👁️** icon (page or folder)
- **Handouts:** click images to view full screen and **Show to players**
- **Token links:** right-click a token to link a page and open it instantly later
- **Reload when needed:** use **🔄** to pull the latest changes

## Start Here (built-in onboarding)

GM Vault includes a small "Start Here" structure in every room so you can learn by using it:

- **⭐ Quick Start** (what buttons do)
- **Handout — Mysterious Map** (try full screen + show to players)
- **Enemy — Goblin** (link to a token)
- **Notes — Session Notes** (a ready-to-use Notion template)

> You can edit, rename, or delete everything. Nothing is shared unless you choose to.

## Quick start

1) Add GM Vault using this manifest URL:  
https://owlbear-gm-vault.netlify.app/manifest.json

2) Open the extension inside your room

3) Try the **⭐ Start Here** folder:
- Click an item to open it
- Toggle **👁️** to share/hide
- Click the image to show it full screen

4) Build your own structure with **➕** (folders + pages)

## Notion setup (optional)

To use private Notion pages, you first need to get your Notion token (see [this tutorial](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration#create-your-integration-in-notion)), and then upload it in the **Settings** panel.
Players don’t need a token.
