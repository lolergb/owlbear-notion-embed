# DM Panel

DM Panel is a lightweight DM panel for Owlbear Rodeo.  
Open **Notion pages**, **PDFs**, and **links** inside your room — keep content **DM-only by default** and share selected notes and handouts with players when it matters.

> **Official builds:** Only manifests served from `owlbear-dm-panel.netlify.app` are official. See [TRADEMARK.md](https://github.com/lolergb/owlbear-dm-panel/blob/main/TRADEMARK.md) for branding policy.

## Highlights

- **Organize your prep:** folders + subfolders (Acts, Encounters, NPCs, Handouts…)
- **Open fast during play:** click any item to view it in a modal
- **Share with players:** toggle visibility with the **👁️** icon (page or folder)
- **Handouts:** click images to view full screen and **Show to players**
- **Token links:** right-click a token to link a page and open it instantly later
- **Reload when needed:** use **🔄** to pull the latest changes

## Start Here (built-in onboarding)

DM Panel includes a small “Start Here” structure in every room so you can learn by using it:

- **⭐ Quick Start** (what buttons do)
- **Handout — Mysterious Map** (try full screen + show to players)
- **Enemy — Goblin** (link to a token)
- **Notes — Session Notes** (a ready-to-use Notion template)

> You can edit, rename, or delete everything. Nothing is shared unless you choose to.
