## 🚀 Deploy to Netlify

### Basic steps

1. **Fork/clone this repository**

2. **Create a Netlify account** (free)

3. **Connect your repository:**
   - "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
   - Connect GitHub/GitLab → Select this repo

4. **Automatic deployment:**
   - Netlify will detect and deploy automatically
   - **You don't need to configure token** - each user will configure their own

5. **Share the URL:**
   - Example: `https://your-project.netlify.app/manifest.json`
   - Share this URL with users
   - **Each user will configure their own token** from the interface (🔑 button)

### Optional server token

If you want it to work without users configuring anything (shared pages):

1. **In Netlify Dashboard:**
   - Settings → Environment variables
   - Add: `NOTION_API_TOKEN` = `your_notion_token`
   - Get the token: https://www.notion.so/my-integrations

2. **In Notion:**
   - Share your pages with the integration
   - Users will see these pages without configuring anything

3. **Users can:**
   - Use shared pages (without token)
   - Or configure their own token (🔑) for their pages

## 🔧 Local Development

### Requirements

- Static web server (any works)
- Notion pages configured as private (shared with integration) or public

### Configuration

1. **Local server:**
   ```bash
   npm run serve
   # or
   npx http-server -p 8000
   ```

2. **Use in Owlbear:**
   - `http://localhost:8000/manifest.json`

3. **Configure your token:**
   - Open the extension in Owlbear
   - Click the **🔑** button (top right)
   - Paste your Notion token
   - Done! You can now use your pages

**Note:** Configuration is managed completely from the interface. You don't need local configuration files.

## 🧪 Test that it works

To test that the extension works:

1. **Open Owlbear Rodeo** and enter a room
2. **Open the extension** from the extensions menu
3. **Configure your token** by clicking the **🔑** button
4. **Add a page** from the interface
5. **Click on the page** to verify it loads correctly

**If there are errors:**
- **Invalid token:** Verify that the token is correct (must start with `secret_` or `ntn_`)
- **No permissions:** Make sure the Notion integration has access to the page
- **Page not found:** Verify that the URL is correct and that the page is shared with the integration

## 🔐 Security

**For Developers:**

- ✅ Token is stored in Netlify (environment variables) - optional
- ✅ Token is NEVER exposed to the client (uses Netlify Functions as proxy)
- ✅ End users configure their own token from the interface (🔑 button)
- ✅ User tokens are stored locally in the browser (localStorage)
- ✅ Server token is optional and only used if user token is not configured

**For Users:**

- ✅ You don't need to know anything about tokens
- ✅ Just use the extension normally
- ✅ Your token is stored locally and never sent to the server (except through secure Netlify Functions)

## 📚 Documentation

### User Documentation
- **[README.md](../README.md):** Main user guide with installation, usage, and troubleshooting
- **[USER_FEATURES.md](USER_FEATURES.md):** Complete guide to all UI features, buttons, and functionality

### Owlbear SDK

This extension uses the official Owlbear Rodeo SDK:
- [Documentation](https://docs.owlbear.rodeo/)
- [Modal API](https://docs.owlbear.rodeo/extensions/apis/modal/)

## 📝 Development Notes

- Notion pages can be **private** (they don't need to be public) if shared with the integration
- The modal opens with a responsive size
- You can have multiple pages configured
- The extension is completely private if you don't share it publicly
- **✅ Security:** Tokens are managed from the interface and stored locally (localStorage)

## 🔄 Content Sharing Architecture

### How it works

**Problem:** Room metadata has a 16KB size limit, but rendered Notion HTML can be much larger.

**Solution:** Use `OBR.broadcast` for real-time content sharing between GM and players.

**Flow:**
1. **GM loads a Notion page:**
   - Fetches blocks from Notion API (using GM's token)
   - Renders HTML from blocks
   - Stores rendered HTML in local memory cache (not room metadata)
   - Sets up broadcast listener to respond to player requests

2. **Player requests content:**
   - Player clicks on a visible page
   - Sends broadcast message: `BROADCAST_CHANNEL_REQUEST` with `pageId`
   - Shows "Waiting..." message while waiting for response

3. **GM responds:**
   - Receives broadcast request
   - Looks up HTML in local cache
   - Sends broadcast message: `BROADCAST_CHANNEL_RESPONSE` with `pageId` and `html`
   - Player receives HTML and displays it

**Key Components:**
- `localHtmlCache`: In-memory cache on GM side (max 20 pages)
- `requestHtmlFromGM()`: Player function to request content
- `setupGMContentBroadcast()`: GM listener for player requests
- `saveHtmlToLocalCache()`: GM function to cache rendered HTML

**Benefits:**
- No size limits (broadcast doesn't have 16KB limit)
- Real-time sharing (instant updates)
- No token required for players
- Works as long as GM has extension open

**Limitations:**
- GM must have extension open for sharing to work
- Content is not persisted (cleared when GM closes extension)
- 5-second timeout if GM doesn't respond
