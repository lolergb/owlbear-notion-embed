- **Automatic reload:** Content is cached for fast loading
- **🔄 Button:** Forces reload of a specific page (useful if you updated Notion)
- **Cache management:** Available in the Settings panel

### Token integration

You can link pages directly to tokens/characters in the scene:

1. **Right-click on any token** in the scene
2. Select **"Link page"**
3. Choose a page from your configuration
4. The page is now linked to that token

**To view a linked page:**
- Right-click on the token → **"View linked page"**

**To unlink:**
- Right-click on the token → **"Unlink page"** - GM only

**Note:** Only the GM can link/unlink pages. All players can view linked pages.

### Player visibility and content sharing

**By default, all pages are hidden from players.** The GM must explicitly mark pages as visible for players to see them.

#### For Game Masters (GM)

**Control page visibility:**
1. **Toggle page visibility:** Click the **👁️** button next to any page to show/hide it from players
2. **Toggle category visibility:** Click the **👁️** button next to any folder to show/hide all pages in that folder (and subfolders)
3. **Page header toggle:** When viewing a page, use the **👁️** button in the header to toggle visibility
4. **Image sharing:** When viewing an image, click **"Show to players"** to share it with all players

**How content sharing works:**
- When the GM views a Notion page, the rendered HTML is cached locally
- Players can request this content via broadcast (no Notion token required)
- The GM automatically responds with the cached content
- Players see the exact same rendered content as the GM

**Important:**
- The GM must have the extension open to share content with players
- Players will see a "Waiting for the GM to load this content..." message if the GM hasn't viewed the page yet
- Players can click "Retry" to request content again

#### For Players

**What you can see:**
- Only pages marked as visible by the GM
- Content shared by the GM (no Notion token required)
- Images shared by the GM via the image viewer

**What you cannot do:**
- Add, edit, or delete pages or folders
- Change page visibility
- Access settings
- View pages that the GM hasn't marked as visible

**Empty state:**
- If the GM hasn't shared any content, you'll see: "No shared pages - The DM hasn't shared any pages with you yet"

### Supported content

- **Notion pages** - Private or public pages (shared with your integration)
- **PDFs** - Any publicly accessible PDF file
- **External URLs** - Any web page (with optional CSS selectors)

### 💡 Tips

- **Each user has their own token:** Configure your token once and use it in all rooms
- **Each room is independent:** Pages are configured per room, but the token is shared
- **Private token:** Your token is stored locally in your browser, only you can see it
- **Notion URLs:** You can use private pages (they don't need to be public) if you share them with your integration
- **Icons:** Pages automatically show their Notion icon
- **Images:** Click on any image to view it at full size
- **Change token:** Click **🔑** → Delete Token to go back to using the server token (if configured)
- **Player visibility:** By default, all pages are hidden from players. Use the **👁️** button to make pages visible
- **Content sharing:** Players don't need a Notion token to view pages shared by the GM
- **GM must be online:** The GM needs to have the extension open for players to receive shared content

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Page doesn't open:**
- Verify that the Notion URL is correct
- Make sure the URL is complete (without `?source=...` parameters)
- Check that the page is shared with your integration

**External content doesn't load:**
- For PDFs: Make sure the URL is publicly accessible
- For external URLs: Some pages block iframes for security (CORS)
- Check the browser console for CORS or iframe errors

**Extension doesn't appear:**
- Verify that `manifest.json` is publicly accessible
- Check that the manifest URL is correct in Owlbear

**Token error:**
- Verify that your token is correct (starts with `secret_` or `ntn_`)
- Make sure the integration has access to the pages you're trying to view

**Cache issues:**
- Use the 🔄 button to reload a specific page
- Use the 🗑️ button to clear all cache

**Player can't see pages:**
- Make sure the GM has marked the page as visible (👁️ button should show eye-open icon)
- Verify the GM has the extension open (required for content sharing)
- Player should see "Waiting for the GM to load this content..." if the GM hasn't viewed the page yet
- Player can click "Retry" to request content again

**Content not loading for players:**
- GM must view the page first to cache the content
- GM must have the extension open for broadcast to work
- Check browser console for broadcast errors
