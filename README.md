          "blockTypes": ["heading_1", "heading_2", "heading_3"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Minimum example (one folder, one page):**

```json
{
  "categories": [
    {
      "name": "General",
      "pages": [
        {
          "name": "My Page",
          "url": "https://your-notion.notion.site/My-Page-2d0d4856c90e80f6801dcafb6b7366e6"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** The JSON structure uses `"categories"` as the key name for backward compatibility, but in the UI they are displayed as "folders" (carpetas).

**Important notes:**
- Folders and pages are displayed in the same order as in the JSON (no automatic sorting)
- Subfolders are displayed with visual indentation to indicate hierarchy
- Each folder and subfolder can be collapsed/expanded independently
- `selector` only works with external URLs (non-Notion)
- `blockTypes` only works with Notion URLs (ignored in external URLs)
- For Notion pages, `selector` is ignored (Notion API is used)
- For external URLs, `blockTypes` is ignored (only applies to Notion)
- Page icons are automatically loaded from Notion or detected by service type
- You can nest subfolders to any level (unlimited depth)
- Use `blockTypes` to create filtered views of a page (e.g., only quotes, only callouts, etc.)
- **URL Conversion:** Supported services are automatically converted to embed format
- **Service Icons:** Each service type has its own icon (Google Drive, YouTube, PDF, etc.)
- **Public Sharing Required:** For Google Drive/Docs/Sheets/Slides, files must be shared as "Anyone with the link can view"

### 🔄 Update content

- **Automatic reload:** Content is cached for fast loading
- **🔄 Button:** Forces reload of a specific page (useful if you updated Notion)
- **Cache management:** Available in Settings panel

### 🎯 Token Integration

You can link pages directly to tokens/characters in the scene:

1. **Right-click on any token** in the scene
2. Select **"Vincular página"** (Link page)
3. Choose a page from your configuration
4. The page is now linked to that token

**To view a linked page:**
- Right-click on the token → **"Ver página vinculada"** (View linked page)

**To unlink:**
- Right-click on the token → **"Desvincular página"** (Unlink page) - GM only

**Note:** Only the GM can link/unlink pages. All players can view linked pages.

### 🔗 Supported External Services

The extension automatically converts URLs to embed format for:

- **Google Drive** - Files shared publicly
- **Google Docs** - Documents shared publicly
- **Google Sheets** - Spreadsheets shared publicly
- **Google Slides** - Presentations shared publicly
- **Dropbox** - Files with public links
- **OneDrive** - Files with embed links
- **YouTube** - Public videos
- **Vimeo** - Public videos
- **Figma** - Files shared publicly
- **PDFs** - Any publicly accessible PDF file

**Note:** For Google services, files must be shared as "Anyone with the link can view" to work in iframes.

### 💡 Tips

- **Each user has their own token:** Configure your token once and use it in all rooms
- **Each room is independent:** Pages are configured per room, but the token is shared
- **Private token:** Your token is stored locally in your browser, only you can see it
- **Notion URLs:** You can use private pages (they don't need to be public) if you share them with your integration
- **Icons:** Pages automatically show their Notion icon
- **Images:** Click on any image to view it at full size
- **Change token:** Click **🔑** → Delete Token to go back to using the server token (if configured)

## 🛠️ For Developers (Deployment Only)

> **⚠️ This section is ONLY for whoever deploys the extension. End users do NOT need to do this.**

### 🚀 Deploy to Netlify

1. **Fork/clone this repository**

2. **Create a Netlify account** (free)

3. **Connect your repository:**
   - "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
   - Connect GitHub/GitLab → Select this repo

4. **Automatic deployment:**
   - Netlify will detect and deploy automatically
   - **You don't need to configure token** - each user will configure their own

5. **Share the URL:**
   - Example: `https://your-project.netlify.app/manifest.json`
   - Share this URL with users
   - **Each user will configure their own token** from the interface (🔑 button)

### 🔧 Optional Server Token

If you want it to work without users configuring anything (shared pages):

1. **In Netlify Dashboard:**
   - Settings → Environment variables
   - Add: `NOTION_API_TOKEN` = `your_notion_token`
   - Get the token: https://www.notion.so/my-integrations

2. **In Notion:**
   - Share your pages with the integration
   - Users will see these pages without configuring anything

3. **Users can:**
   - Use shared pages (without token)
   - Or configure their own token (🔑) for their pages

### 📝 Configure initial pages (Optional)

Pages can be managed from the interface, but you can configure initial pages by editing `build-config.js`:

```javascript
export const NOTION_PAGES = [
  {
    name: "My Adventure",
    url: "https://your-notion.notion.site/My-Adventure-..."
  }
];
```

### 🔧 Local Development

1. **Copy the example file:**
   ```bash
   cp config/config.example.js config/config.js
   ```

2. **Edit `config/config.js`** and add your token (only for local development):
   ```javascript
   export const NOTION_API_TOKEN = "your_notion_token_here";
   ```

3. **Local server:**
   ```bash
   npm run serve
   # or
   npx http-server -p 8000
   ```

4. **Use in Owlbear:**
   - `http://localhost:8000/manifest.json`

#### For GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages only serves static files, so you can't use environment variables directly. Options:

- **Option A (Simple - Development only):**
  - Keep `config.js` local and don't upload it to GitHub (already in `.gitignore`)
  - ⚠️ **Warning:** If someone accesses your site, the token will be visible in the client code

- **Option B (Secure - Requires GitHub Actions):**
  - Create a GitHub Actions workflow
  - Use GitHub Secrets to store the token
  - The workflow generates `config.js` at build time
  - See example in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (create if necessary)

### 🔓 Make a Notion page public

1. Open your page in Notion
2. Click "Share" (top right)
3. Enable "Share to web"
4. Copy the public URL
5. Paste it in the extension configuration

## 🧪 Test that it works

Before using the extension, verify that the Notion API is configured correctly:

```bash
# Run the test script
npm test
# or directly:
node scripts/test-notion-api.js
```

The script will verify:
- ✅ That `config.js` exists and has the token configured
- ✅ That the token is valid
- ✅ That it can access the configured pages
- ✅ That it gets blocks correctly

**If there are errors:**
- **Invalid token:** Verify that the token is correct in `config.js`
- **No permissions:** Make sure the Notion integration has access to the pages
- **Page not found:** Verify that the URLs in `config.js` are correct

## 🎮 Usage

1. **Open Owlbear Rodeo** and create/open a room
2. **Select the extension** from the extensions menu
3. **Click on a page** to open it in a modal
4. **Navigate** through your Notion content without leaving Owlbear

## 🔧 Development

### Requirements

- Static web server (any works)
- Notion pages configured as private (shared with integration) or public

### Owlbear SDK

This extension uses the official Owlbear Rodeo SDK:
- [Documentation](https://docs.owlbear.rodeo/)
- [Modal API](https://docs.owlbear.rodeo/extensions/apis/modal/)

## 📝 Notes

- Notion pages can be **private** (they don't need to be public) if shared with the integration
- The modal opens with a responsive size
- You can have multiple pages configured
- The extension is completely private if you don't share it publicly
- **⚠️ Security:** The API token is in `config.js` which is NOT uploaded to GitHub (it's in `.gitignore`)

## 🔐 Security

**For Developers:**

- ✅ Token is stored in Netlify (environment variables)
- ✅ Token is NEVER exposed to the client (uses Netlify Functions as proxy)
- ✅ `config.js` is in `.gitignore` and NOT uploaded to GitHub
- ✅ End users never see or need the token
- ✅ User tokens are stored locally in the browser (localStorage)
- ✅ Server token is optional and only used if user token is not configured

**For Users:**

- ✅ You don't need to know anything about tokens
- ✅ Just use the extension normally
- ✅ Your token is stored locally and never sent to the server (except through secure Netlify Functions)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Page doesn't open:**
- Verify that the Notion URL is correct
- Make sure the URL is complete (without `?source=...` parameters)
- Check that the page is shared with your integration

**External service doesn't load:**
- For Google services: Make sure the file is shared as "Anyone with the link can view"
- For Dropbox/OneDrive: Verify the file has a public link
- For YouTube/Vimeo: Ensure the video is public or unlisted (not private)
- Check browser console for CORS or iframe errors

**Extension doesn't appear:**
- Verify that `manifest.json` is publicly accessible
- Check that the manifest URL is correct in Owlbear

**CORS error:**
- Make sure to host the extension on a server (don't use `file://`)

**Token error:**
- Verify that your token is correct (starts with `secret_` or `ntn_`)
- Make sure the integration has access to the pages you're trying to view

**Cache issues:**
- Use the 🔄 button to reload a specific page
- Use the 🗑️ button to clear all cache
